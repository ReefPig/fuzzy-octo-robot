<p> Kathleen, I know this must all be strange to you. I created this website and a series of puzzles so that only you could possibly find the photo. In the scenario that I am kidnapped you must find and destroy it before they do.  </p>

<a id="designer-templates" class="anchor" href="#designer-templates" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>The next puzzle</h3>

<p>To continue your destiny you need to open this document and follow the instructions within. However I password protected it. The password is the color of the car parked on the opposite side of the street where I was planning to take you in SF. I know this is vague but I need to be careful so you're the only one who can do this. Good luck. My dignitiy is in your hands </p>
